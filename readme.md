Health Care System:
The "Health Care System" is a business solution for managing a hospital's day-to-day operations.
This program was designed to work as a whole, with components such as Employees, Doctors, Patients, and Bills. 
The proposed system will track employees, doctors, patients, and accounts, as well as produce reports outlining the organization. 
This project's GUI-based software will assist in the creation of users, the storage of patient information, 
and the retrieval of the information via several user-friendly menu-driven modules.
